Question 2: Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A.

Use databases when the following is important: 

   a) Data integrity validation
   b) Update data easily a reliably
   c) Query tasks handling (and avoid crawling over a file)
   d) Handle accesses with multiprocesses/multithreaded mechanisms
   e) Handle accesses from networks
   f) Have a more reliable data management process
   g) Handle great amounts of data that needs indexing, efficient storage, and fast information retrieval
   h) Have a more maintainable data structure
   i) When data security is important

When to use text files:

   a) When data reading speed is not important (when data reaches a certain size)
   b) When you don't mind using a linear searching algorithm with a Big O of O(n^2) for searching for data
   c) When memory management is not important (databases take care of this for you as an example)
   d) When keeping track of where data is located is not required
   e) When you don't have to work collaboratively with other people. 2 people working on the same 
      .txt file would definitely lead to problems sooner or later
   f) When data security is not important

Question 3: Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A. SQL is a declarative while others might be imperative (C++, Ruby or Python)

*****

Question 4: In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A. First of all it is important to determine the size of the data that will be stored and the data types that will be used.
Then, one of the advantages of using databases is the relationships that can be assigned among the data. This will make our 
database more efficient when retrieving data, basically provide a logical structure to the data.

It is impportant also to determine how data will be stored and accessed

When the input data is not normalized, it is important to have a data normalization process so that we can guarantee that
there will not be corrupted data.

Finally, a graphical representation of the database model is always useful to have, so we have a clear hihg-level picture of it.

Question 5: Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A.

Table: a table structure is a set of data elements that use a model of vertical columns and horizontal rows.
Row: a row represents a single item in a table.
Column: a column is a set of data values of a particular simple type.
Value: values is a piece of data placed in the intersection of the column and row. A value is of a certain data type

Question 6: List three data types that can be used in a table.

A.

1) Character
2) Boolean
3) Date

     Query SQL:   SELECT email, signup
	               FROM users
                  WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data'; 
     Output:
                  email	            signup
                  datad@comcast.net	2008-01-20T00:00:00.000Z

2) The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

     Query SQL:   SELECT userid
	               FROM users
                  WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';
     Output:                        
                  userid
                  1
